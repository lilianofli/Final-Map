   <p class="historical-context"> 
     Nearly all of today's popular U.S.A foods (apple pie, hot dogs, hamburgers, pizza, tacos, chocolate, jelly beans, ice cream, steak, potato salad, watermelons) originated in other countries. Their ingredients and recipes were introduced to our shores by colonists, settlers, and immigrants. Native ingredients play a key role but they do not tell the entire story. In fact, many of the "new world" foods arrived to the USA via Europe.

     <h2> Dinner: Mac and Cheese</h2>
     <img src="Mac and Cheese.jpg" alt="Mac and Cheese">
     <p>Although it is an American staple, the dish was probably inspired by various pasta and cheese dishes that were enjoyed in Italy, France, and the United Kingdom, before its appearance in the United States. It was Thomas Jefferson who eventually popularized it, when he had the pasta machine shipped back home to Virginia and served the dish at his lavish banquets, while in 1824, his distant cousin Mary Randolph published the first mac and cheese recipe.Nowadays, mac and cheese is the ultimate comfort food dish in the United States, and in 2007, it was proclaimed the fourth most iconic American food in a survey conducted by James Beard Foundation. </p>

     <h3> Recipe </h3>
     <h5>Ingredients</h5>
   <ul>
     <li>6 tbsp unsalted butter, plus more to grease the baking dish</li>
     <li>1 cup (120g) panko breadcrumbs</li>
     <li>24 ounces (680g) sharp or extra-sharp Cheddar, grated</li>
     <li>14 ounces (400g) elbow macaroni</li>
     <li>3 ¼ cups (780ml) whole milk</li>
     <li>3 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
     <li>1 ½ tsp dry mustard</li>
     <li>1 tsp fine sea salt</li>
     <li>1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
   </ul>

     <h5>Instructions</h5>
   <ol>
     <li>Set the oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9x13-inch (23x33cm) baking dish with butter. Place the panko breadcrumbs in a small bowl, then melt three tablespoons of butter in a small saucepan over moderate heat.</li>
     <li>Once melted, drizzle the butter over the panko breadcrumbs and toss them to ensure they are all coated. Next, add a handful of grated cheese to the buttered breadcrumbs and stir them to combine.</li>
     <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add the elbow macaroni, and cook until al dente. Drain, but do not rinse, and return to the pot.</li>
     <li>Warm the milk in a small saucepan over moderate heat and right as the milk begins to steam, and tiny bubbles start to appear around the edges, remove from the heat — the milk should not boil.</li>
     <li>In a medium saucepan, add the remaining butter and melt it over moderate heat. Once melted add the flour and using a flat-edged wooden spoon blend the butter and flour together making sure you scrape the bottom to prevent the mixture from burning.</li>
     <li>After about three minutes, the mixture should turn light brown in color at which point, slowly pour in the warm milk while constantly stirring for about three minutes until the sauce thickens.</li>
     <li>Remove from the heat, add the seasonings (dry mustard, salt, and pepper) and stir them in. Lastly, add the remaining grated cheese into the sauce and stir until it has completely melted.</li>
     <li>Pour the resulting sauce over the pasta, and stir, making sure that every piece of pasta is evenly coated in the sauce.</li>
     <li>Scrape the macaroni and cheese into the previously greased baking dish, smooth out the surface and sprinkle with the panko-cheese mixture.</li>
     <li>Bake for 30 minutes in a preheated oven or until the top is light golden brown in color.</li>
   </ol>
