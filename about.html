		<h3>Objective</h3>
		<p>It is easy to feel alone during this pandemic. We are desperate for something new, and people have shared all kinds of food trends and recipes. In our website, we wanted to make that information more accessible and inclusive. We included all regions in the world and added meal options to fully cater to everyone. Now go try and enjoy a new meal!</p>
